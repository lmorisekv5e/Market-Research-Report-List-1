<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Heating Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-condensing Boilers</li><li>Condensing Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial heating boilers market features two primary types: non-condensing and condensing boilers. Non-condensing boilers operate at higher temperatures, resulting in lower efficiency, as they release waste heat through flue gases. In contrast, condensing boilers utilize heat recovery technology to capture and reuse this waste heat, achieving higher energy efficiency and reduced emissions. While non-condensing models are often less expensive, condensing boilers offer long-term savings through lower energy costs and environmental benefits, driving their growing popularity in commercial applications.</p></p>
