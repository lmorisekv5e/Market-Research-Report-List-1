<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Operated Aluminum Diaphragm Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Air Operated Aluminum Diaphragm Pump market is divided into two primary types: single acting and double acting. Single acting pumps utilize air pressure to drive the diaphragm in one direction, creating a suction effect during the return stroke. In contrast, double acting pumps employ air pressure on both sides of the diaphragm, allowing for a continuous flow of fluid by creating suction and discharge simultaneously. This distinction influences performance, efficiency, and application suitability in various industrial contexts.</p></p>
