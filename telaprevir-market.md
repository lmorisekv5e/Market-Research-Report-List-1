<p><strong>What Are The Key Opportunities For Telaprevir Manufacturers?</strong></p>
<p><p>Telaprevir, a protease inhibitor originally used for treating hepatitis C, experienced significant market growth post-approval in 2011 due to its effectiveness when paired with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. However, the market has since evolved with the introduction of more advanced and safer direct-acting antiviral agents, which has diminished telaprevir's use. Current trends indicate a shift towards combination therapies with improved safety profiles. The future outlook suggests a continued decline in telaprevir's market share, as healthcare providers favor newer agents, yet it may maintain a niche role in specific patient populations resistant to alternative treatments.</p></p>
